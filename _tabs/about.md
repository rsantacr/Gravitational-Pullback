**What Here?**

Hilbert's Infinite Dice is a personal website to talk about RPGs, but also a possible space for scientific and mathematical discussions.

Here you can find ideas, opinions and whatnot about the Indie and OSR parts of this interesting hobby. 

Sometimes you can find some stuff related to Hilbert, Emmy Noether or even Schr√∂dinger. And if I am feeling *really* lucky I may mention Quantum Gravity.

**Interesting Games**

Some of the games I find interesing are:
- Fate and metacurrency games
- The line of games derived from the Apocalypse, PbtA
- OSR and the Rulings not Rules ideas
- The NewSchoolRevolution and their fresh ideas such as Bastionland, Cairn, etc.
