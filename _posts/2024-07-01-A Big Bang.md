The universe started with a Big (and definitely very loud) Bang, or so it is said.

I do not expect to write about the Big Bang (or any of its variations) in this blog, but instead I will try to write, and think, about some parts of the RPG hobby. Nothing new. It will be stuff that probably other people already thought, but hopefully it will be a different space and a refreshing perspective.What you can *expect* to find here is an amalgamation of questions, mechanics and, maybe, if I have time and I am brave enough, fantasy and Sci-Fi adventures.

Part of why I start this blog is that I believe that some part of information is somehow lost during the act of writing and reading it on several social networks (namely Twitter) where the vast majority of RPG people is virtually located. The social networks are, by design, counterproductive to keep track of written ideas and the task is much more fit for a blog.

Another part is the naivety and vanity of thinking that what I have to say is relevant to some degree. But do not worry about that, I am inclined to think that opinions are close to worthless, *that being the reason why they can be freely given*.

In any case, if at some point I feel like writing about Physics, Geometry or Gradient Descent (not the [Mothership](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set){:target="_blank"} one, but the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent){:target="_blank"} one), I might just do it in here to
